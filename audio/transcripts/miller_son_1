A Miller, accompanied by his young Son, was driving his Ass to market in hopes of finding a purchaser for him. On the road they met a troop of girls, laughing and talking, who exclaimed, Did you ever see such a pair of fools? To be trudging along the dusty road when they might be riding! The Miller thought there was sense in what they said; so he made his Son mount the Ass, and himself walked at the side. Presently they met some of his old cronies, who greeted them and said, Youll spoil that Son of yours, letting him ride while you toil along on foot! Make him walk, young lazybones! Itll do him all the good in the world. The Miller followed their advice, and took his Sons place on the back of the Ass while the boy trudged along behind. They had not gone far when they overtook a party of women and children, and the Miller heard them say, What a selfish old man! He himself rides in comfort, but lets his poor little boy follow as best he can on his own legs! So he made his Son get up behind him.
