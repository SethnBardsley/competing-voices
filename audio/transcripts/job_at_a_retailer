I work as a sales associate for my local retail store. It is located about two miles away from where I live,
and it is in the city. It towers all the other buildings around it and is three stories tall.
For my job, I help customers reach high items or find items that they are need help looking for. There
are two ways that a customer can signal for help. The first is that they can directly call out to me if I am
standing nearby. The second is that they can push a service button that will notify me. After I receive
the location of where the customer pushed the button, I go to them and assist them.
